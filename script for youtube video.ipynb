      "   - **Nick:** \"And it's important to talk about these feelings and know you're not alone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Questions for the Audience:**\n",
      "   - **Zara:** \"What are some ways you express your feelings? Do you talk to someone, write it down, or maybe draw?\"\n",
      "   - Allow a moment for children to think or discuss with peers or guardians.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Moral of the Story:**\n",
      "   - Towards the end, bring the characters back to reinforce the moral of the story.\n",

The scene now includes pauses for children to interact, questions that allow them to express their feelings, and reinforces the message that they are loved and not alone despite changes. This script meets the criteria of being engaging and supportive for children dealing with sensitive topics.\n",
